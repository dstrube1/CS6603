a & c: accounts of denied loan 
n1 & n2: number of people in each group
p1: proportion of loans denied for protected group
p2: proportion of loans denied for unprotected group

book:
p25
model: an abstract representation of some process
input, output, how to evaluate success, constraints, blind spots, 

p29
LSI–R: Level of Service Inventory–Revised

three kinds of models: baseball models, hypothetical family meal model, and recidivism model
3 key questions:
is the model opaque, or even invisible?
Does it damage or destroy lives?
can it scale?

Ch 4: p62

variance:
average of squares of deviations of the observations from their mean;
ex: 2,4,6,8,10
sum = 30
n (number of elements) = 5
30/5 = 6 = average
variance = ((x1 - avg)^2 + ... (xn -avg)^2) / (n-1)
	= ((2-6)^2 + (4-6)^2 + (6-6)^2 + (8-6)^2 + (10-6)^2 ) / (5 - 1)
	= ((-4)^2 + (-2)^2 + (0)^2 + (2)^2 + (4)^2 ) / 4
	= (16 + 4 + 0 + 4 + 16) / 4
	= 40 / 4 = 10
population standard deviation is equal to the square root of the variance
	
correlation:
0 - 0.39 = very weak - weak positive linear relationship
0.4 - 0.6 = moderate
0.7 - 1.0 = strong - very strong

IO b/n 90-110: average; 
> 120: superior; 
~68% pop: 85-115; 
avg: 70-130: 95% of pop;

20% is not within 30% +/-4%:
30% + 4% = 34%
30% - 4% = 26%
20% is outside the range of 26-34%
30% is outside the margin of error?

Bias is a learner’s tendency to consistently learn the same wrong thing. 
Variance is the tendency to learn random things irrespective of the real signal

==================================

neural networks have high accuracy but long training times and difficult interpretation
KNN: Takes a long time to train, and is easy to overfit

if the model is doing something bad (like sending people to jail), then more false + is better than more false -
if the model is doing something good (like giving people loans), then more false - is better than more false +

Accuracy, error rate, precision, etc:
